# UI-UX-Designs

Eco-Eats UI Design: I present a user-friendly mobile application design that prioritizes your health and the planet. This app connects users with restaurants and grocers offering delicious, healthy food options, all delivered in an eco-friendly way.  The UI is designed from the ground up to be intuitive and visually appealing, showcasing healthy meal options and highlighting the sustainable practices of partnered vendors. Functional prototypes demonstrate the user journey, from browsing menus based on dietary needs to checkout with options for reusable packaging or carbon offset delivery. This app empowers users to make informed choices that nourish both their bodies and the planet.
